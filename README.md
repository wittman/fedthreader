Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;<br>

I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.<br>
But stay! O spite!<br>
But mark, poor knight,<br>
What dreadful dole is here!<br>
Eyes, do you see?<br>
How can it be?<br>
O dainty duck! O dear!<br>
Thy mantle good,<br>
What, stain’d with blood?<br>
Approach, ye Furies fell!<br>
O Fates, come, come,<br>
Cut thread and thrum,<br>
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
</blockquote>

sight.
But stay! O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,

blood?
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum,
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! 3/3
```

## Fine tuning
Let's add a couple “hard breaks” (two blank lines) before “I trust to take” and also “Thy mantle good”.

This prevents an orphan word in slices <small>2/3</small> and <small>3/3</small>.

### Other Configuration

Checkmark `URLs only considered 23 characters long` to turn on special URL handling to get more text into each post when large URLs are involved.
 
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.help) allows long URLs to only be consider 23 characters long—this option takes advantage of that.

URLs will be recognized as such if it begins with `https://` and is followed by a space or new line.

Avoid:
>Something (https://example.com/something)

by adding a space before the close parenthesis.
>Something ( https://example.com/something )
